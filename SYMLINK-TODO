* Add support to synchronize symbolic links
  - This needs a lot of work cause we have to check the symlink
    + Determine if a symlink points outside the current directory tree. They
      are unsafe to sync.
    + Null symlinks and absolute symlinks are always unsafe.
  - Check which is the best way to sync symlinks
  - Add check to modules to check whether they support symlinks

- Add a supports symlink capability to the vio modules. If it's true,
  the module needs to implement is_absolute() and symlink().
